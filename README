This is an example of using WAFFLE to authenticate a client to a server using single sign on (SSO) using the Negotiate Security Support Provider.  It passes messages back and forth using Netty.

Start the server using the following (changing the ip address to either to the ip address of the server or the hostname of the server, change the port number if that conflicts as well:

	server.bat -n 10.0.1.165 -p 8888

Start the client on the citrix client using the following:

	client.bat -n 10.0.1.165 -p 8888

you can specify the SPN name by passing a -s parameter on the client.bat file:
i.e.
	client.bat -n 10.0.1.165 -p 8888 -s foo
